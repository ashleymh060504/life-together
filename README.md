## Description


This full-stack web application provides a space for users to keep track of all of the chores or tasks they want or need to accomplish. 
It currently includes 2 pages, which are the Sign up/Log in page and the User's page where all of their chores/tasks can be viewed, added to and edited.  
<!--

<!-- To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ``` -->

## Future Plans

We have plans to expand this application to allow users to create groups for shared chore/task management. Users will be able to:
1. Invite familiy members, roommates, etc. to their group.
2. Assign roles for their group members, to include "Adult" or "Child".
3. Assign/Edit tasks/chores for other members of their group depending on their role.

And much much more!
